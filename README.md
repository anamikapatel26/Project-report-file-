Customer Market Segmentation Project

Project Overview

This project performs customer market segmentation using clustering techniques and visualizes the results through an interactive dashboard. The aim is to group customers based on purchasing behavior and demographic characteristics to inform marketing strategies, improve customer targeting, and boost sales.

Dataset

Source: Mall Customers Dataset (Kaggle)

Features:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer

Gender: Male/Female

Age: Customer age

Annual Income (k$): Yearly income in thousand dollars

Spending Score (1-100): Measure of spending habits


Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, 


Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Scaling numerical features (if required)



2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing distributions of age, income, spending score, etc.

Checking correlations between features



3. Clustering:

KMeans clustering used to segment customers

Determining optimal number of clusters using the elbow method



4. Visualization:

Scatter plots and 3D visualizations to show cluster separation




Results

Customers are segmented into distinct clusters based on spending patterns and demographics.

Each cluster represents a specific group (e.g., high income & high spending, low income & low spending) for targeted marketing strategies.
